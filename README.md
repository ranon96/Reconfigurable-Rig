# Reconfigurable Rig

This is an aerial photography rig designed as a project of [Public Lab](http://www.publiclab.org) which includes hardware and a set of laser cut or 3D printed plates. The goal is to create an affordable yet versatile rig that can be reconfigured in a number of ways for use in pole, balloon, and kite aerial photography.

For information on assembling your own Reconfigurable Rig, see the [part acquisition list](/Part Acquisition List/Part Acquisition List.md) and [assembly guide](Assembly Guide.md).

It features a rubber band powered pan mechanism which uses a pipe fitting filled with silly putty as resistance, inspired by a [design](https://billboyheritagesurvey.wordpress.com/2013/01/30/the-simon-harbord-silly-putty-sp-rig/) by Simon Harbord.
